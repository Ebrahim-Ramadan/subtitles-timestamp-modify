1
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:05,113
Steve can't drive his stupid used Miata.

2
00:00:05,188 --> 00:00:07,884
- Steve says his Miata is new.
- It's not new! It's used!

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:10,920
I'm sorry. It's just I...

4
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:13,588
No, it's okay. You're right.

5
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:17,622
My sister can't wait to see us
struggling in this swampland.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,101
- How do you know?
- She called me yesterday and she told me.

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:24,038
I can't wait to see your new home.

8
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:27,408
It's a little cozy...

9
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:31,470
but there's always room
for my dear sister.

10
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:34,847
The whole family's so proud of you.

11
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,752
She's just bitter because
I have always been Mom's favorite.

12
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:45,920
That's why she's coming.
She wants Mom to see us struggling.

13
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:47,792
But they will be in for a surprise...

14
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,424
when they see how well we are doing.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,434
But we're not.

16
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:53,992
Yes, but they don't know that.

17
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:57,368
I've never loved you more.

18
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,405
- Gross!
- Ew!

19
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,378
I think it's great that you guys still
have passion in your marriage.

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,330
<i>My relatives were on their way...</i>

21
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:23,990
<i>but the way my parents were acting...</i>

22
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,228
<i>you would have thought
Mariah Carey was coming to visit.</i>

23
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,395
<i>I mean a hot, pre-Nick Cannon...</i>

24
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,531
<i>in the "Washington Wizards dress"
Mariah Carey.</i>

25
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:35,305
<i>They were putting up fake lemon trees
all over the house...</i>

26
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:37,403
<i>fancying up the bathroom.</i>

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,677
<i>Basically doing anything
they could to look like ballers.</i>

28
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>The record should reflect now...</i>

29
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:47,085
<i>that the defendant
is present with counsel.</i>

30
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,818
<i>You may be seated, if you wish.</i>

31
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,689
<i>Even though my parents were tripping...</i>

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,024
<i>I was psyched because
my favorite cousin, Justin, was coming.</i>

33
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,155
<i>Justin was only six months
older than me...</i>

34
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,097
<i>but he was the one
who changed my life forever.</i>

35
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,035
Yo. Check this out.

36
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,403
<i>You are now about to witness...</i>

37
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:06,704
<i>the strength of street knowledge.</i>

38
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:15,843
<i>From that moment on, I was A. W. O...</i>

39
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,910
<i>Asian With Obsession.</i>

40
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:21,548
<i>I couldn't wait to show Justin
how deep my hip-hop knowledge had gotten.</i>

41
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,923
<i>Everything had to be perfect for
when I busted out the new 2Pac.</i>

42
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,086
What's a two-pack?

43
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,288
It's not for you.

44
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:28,853
Your baby ears aren't ready.

45
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,230
Remember the time a ladybug
crawled in my ear?

46
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,202
Evan, Emery.
Grandma Chu will be staying in your room.

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,464
- Grandma party!
- Yay!

48
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,130
You won't be sleeping there.

49
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,572
Aw.

50
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,472
I have made other arrangements.

51
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,102
Why can't we sleep on the couch?

52
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,977
Because then your aunt
and uncle will know...

53
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,040
we don't have enough bedrooms.

54
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:50,449
And they must never know that.

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,010
Okay, I just talked to Mitch...

56
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,215
and we have a great promotion
set for Saturday.

57
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,918
All the boomin' onions
you can eat for 99 cents.

58
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,723
Cattleman's will be packed
when we take your family there.

59
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,286
Won't you lose money?

60
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:03,559
Well, sometimes you have to
spend money you don't have...

61
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:06,466
to make it seem like you
have money that you don't spend.

62
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,004
- Mm!
- Okay, house is ready.

63
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:12,235
Now it's our turn. We need a new look.

64
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:16,836
We need a look that
instantly says... <i>success.</i>

65
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,571
<i>Let me explain.</i>

66
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:21,412
<i>In addition to fake lemon trees...</i>

67
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:24,510
<i>another thing Chinese people
did to show prosperity was get a perm.</i>

68
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:28,284
<i>I don't know why, but to my people,
curls were like dollar signs.</i>

69
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,553
These success perms were a great idea.

70
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,859
I feel like a curly-headed lion
surveying my kingdom.

71
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,493
They're coming! They're coming!

72
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:42,500
We're ready.

73
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,302
Oh!

74
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,636
Connie!

75
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:57,083
- Oh, your boobs are so big!
- I know. They're new.

76
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,314
I had to give up jogging.

77
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,823
Oh, I can tell.

78
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:04,189
Oh! They are big.

79
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,293
Nirvana?

80
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,630
Justin, yo, why you dressed like that?

81
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:16,297
It's grunge. It reflects
what I feel on the inside.

82
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,033
Your shirt looks like a picnic blanket.

83
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,802
Thank you.

84
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:22,743
Where's Steve?

85
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,850
He drove separately.

86
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:32,987
He drove separately for 13 hours...

87
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,321
- Mm.
- Just so he could bring that stupid car.

88
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,200
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

89
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,393
- He got a success perm too.
- I see that.

90
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,165
I can see that.

91
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,833
Did somebody order Chinese?

92
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,378
Ooh! Fancy place.

93
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,009
Have I got the "Huang" house?

94
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,612
- That's a
great joke, Steve. - Oh, hi!

95
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,451
Funny every time you tell it.

96
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:13,120
- Sweet ride, Uncle Steve.
- Hey, thanks, Emery.

97
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,721
If you work hard
and you're smart like me...

98
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,096
someday you can have a brand-new Miata.

99
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,930
Or used, because it's used.

100
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,539
Yo. You want to help me with this?

101
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:29,169
I have my own baggage.

102
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,213
Emotional.

103
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,444
So the furniture store is doing really well,
and I thought, why not?

104
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,486
You only live once, right?

105
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,453
And now you are equipped with airbags.

106
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:45,751
So, how was the trip down?

107
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,820
I know Mom can be
so critical of your driving.

108
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:52,390
- Oh, she was complaining the whole time...
- Mmm.

109
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,095
Ah! Ah-ma!

110
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,438
About you.

111
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:02,706
- What? - She's been feeling a
little abandoned, you know?

112
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,747
Because you abandoned her.

113
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,247
Connie!

114
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,452
Looks like you're
not her favorite anymore.

115
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,011
Guess who is.

116
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:16,252
Are you thinking?
Are you thinking about who is?

117
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,089
- Connie!
- Coming, Ah-ma.

118
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,232
And that's my Lazy Susan,
because, you know, sometimes we get lazy.

119
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,832
Oh, that's my, uh, pager.

120
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,840
We're opening a second store.
Business, right?

121
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,966
Tell me about it.

122
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:38,707
My restaurant is so successful,
I had to put in a dedicated fax line.

123
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,942
It seems kind of quiet now, Louis.

124
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,647
It's in recharge mode. Tired.

125
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,449
All right, Dad. It's all set up.

126
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,291
I brought along my Internet computer.

127
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,125
I need to check on my store's Web page.

128
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,528
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, go, go.

129
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,621
- Go to the bathroom. We got
plenty of time. - Okay.

130
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,559
<i>All right, Deputy Jex,
would you just take a step back, please?</i>

131
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:38,334
<i>This is people's 164-A?
Is that the right-hand glove?</i>

132
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:42,400
<i>Seems to be having a problem
putting the glove on his hand.</i>

133
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,015
The real Juice is loose.

134
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:02,660
Mom, would you like some tea?
You must be so tired.

135
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,529
I have green tea, oolong...

136
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,865
chrysanthemum, Sleepytime!

137
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:10,428
<i>Something was up
with my cousin, but whatever it was...</i>

138
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:12,133
<i>I knew what would snap him out of it.</i>

139
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,041
I was thinking we should start
with the old stuff and work forward.

140
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,241
Are you guys having a rap party?

141
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:19,804
I'm M.C. Hammer!

142
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:23,946
Get out!

143
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,487
Come on. Let's go.

144
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,115
Sorry about that. Kids.

145
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,454
I'm thinking of moving to Seattle.

146
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,919
Or we could just start with this.

147
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:38,057
Oh, uh, I'm not into 2Pac anymore.
He's just a little immature.

148
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,136
You want to listen
to some real grown-up music?

149
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:57,208
This woman's terrible.

150
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,357
Mom won't even talk to me.

151
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,258
Aw. That's too bad.

152
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,853
Thanks for letting me and Steve
stay in your bedroom.

153
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,831
It's cute. Like a little mouse shoe.

154
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,834
You are loving this, aren't you?

155
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,029
Not at all, but if you want...

156
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:18,699
I can put in a good word for you
with Mom during our evening chat.

157
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:21,800
We put on our slippers
and talk about the family.

158
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:25,506
- We call it "slipper talk."
- Okay, fine.

159
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,276
You may be Mom's new favorite...

160
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,116
but I'm going to win her back
by using what's most important to her.

161
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:34,054
- <i>Wheel of Fortune?</i>
- A good bargain.

162
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:38,389
You may be living your fancy lifestyle
with your ta-tas and your Miatas...

163
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,986
but what Mom cares about most
is stretching a dollar.

164
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:42,997
Oh, little sister.

165
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:47,365
Just because Steve and I are cushy
doesn't mean I can't sniff out a good deal.

166
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:50,701
Designer luggage... 75% off.

167
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,469
When I told Mom, she almost smiled.

168
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,807
Well, wait till I show her
these silk throw pillows.

169
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,643
Ninety percent off
from a condemned hospital.

170
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,377
Why don't we go shopping,
see who can find a better deal?

171
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,385
Well, let's take this to the Hole.

172
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:08,856
Tammy's Fashion Hole, where they have
an unprecedented selection of only left shoes.

173
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:12,985
What a coincidence.
That's my preferred discount shoe.

174
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,996
Connie!

175
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,691
Coming, Ah-ma!

176
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,108
Connie and my mom have "slipper talk."

177
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,343
- Steve has a fancy noise box.
- Yeah, it's called Connie.

178
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,008
We need to step up our game.

179
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:39,179
Don't worry, baby. We got this.

180
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,713
So, while this is happening,
I have a chance...

181
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,920
to say how excited I am to show you
Cattleman's Ranch tomorrow.

182
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,758
It's gonna be a full house.

183
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,764
Why wait to see this restaurant
I've heard so much about?

184
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,926
I made a reservation for tonight.

185
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:57,564
Oh, well, I don't think the restaurant
can accommodate on such short notice.

186
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,665
Oh, no, not a problem.
The manager was really nice.

187
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,210
He said there were plenty of tables.

188
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,803
Oh.

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,404
Oh.

190
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,972
Howdy. Cattleman's Ranch.

191
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,382
Mitch, how many tables
are booked for tonight?

192
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:14,150
Uh, let's see. Oh, just one.
Oh, but it's a big party of 10.

193
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,123
Okay, well, there's a change of plans.

194
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,057
Me and my family are coming in tonight.

195
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,992
<i>I need you to fill up the restaurant...</i>

196
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:21,256
any way you can.

197
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,888
I got that big party of 10 coming in.

198
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,830
No, <i>we're</i> the big party of 10!

199
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,461
- You and me?
- Me and my family are the big party of 10!

200
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,337
Let's go. Everybody in.
Dinner's on Uncle Louis tonight.

201
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,844
Do you like my outfit, Mom?
I got a great deal.

202
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,743
Half off on all sport separates.

203
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,679
Mom, you like my jacket?

204
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,184
It was 60% off,
and it glows in the dark...

205
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:47,586
so I save money on electricity too.

206
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:50,625
Oh, hey, boss man.

207
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:53,685
I see you've dropped by for a little
impromptu dinner with the kinfolk.

208
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,788
What's going on?
I told you to pack the place.

209
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:58,663
Yeah, but I did the best I could.
You gave me very little time.

210
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,702
Look, those are my ex-roommates,
Gwendolyn and Fritz.

211
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,294
They just came from the Renaissance Faire.

212
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,635
Hector and Nancy,
they're posing as customers.

213
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,767
And Charlene is the date
that I'm currently on.

214
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,470
This isn't enough people!

215
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,036
Don't worry about it.
We got that party of 10 coming in.

216
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,477
Hey.

217
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,381
Light crowd tonight, huh, Louis?

218
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:19,785
Well, this is just the awkward time
between old people dinner...

219
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,482
and regular dinner, so...

220
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,991
To the king!

221
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,192
Are you wearing a whole new outfit?

222
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:31,893
I bought so many affordable items today,
I couldn't pick just one.

223
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:35,994
Mom, this ski suit was 80% off,
and it came with one pole.

224
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,666
Tennis, Mother?
Eighty-five percent off.

225
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,108
Advantage, Connie.

226
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,671
So is, uh, anyone gonna take our order?

227
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:48,842
Uh...

228
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,218
Welcome to Cattleman's Ranch.
Can I start you off with some drinks?

229
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,030
Aren't you a customer?

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,264
So, tell me about you.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

231
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:11,636
Uh, not anymore. I mean, it's not exactly
something you talk about on a first date...

232
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,574
but for some reason,
I feel like I can really open up to you.

233
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,201
Oh, hold on one second.

234
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,768
Howdy. Cattleman's Ranch.

235
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,338
Yes, we do do to-go orders.

236
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,043
What's the name?

237
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:27,111
Okay, Orenthal... J... Sampson.

238
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,123
Okay.

239
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,759
This roll is stupid.

240
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,627
Dude, why are you such a bummer?

241
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,099
What can I say? I grew up.

242
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:43,537
No, you're played out,
listening to that sad, white-lady music.

243
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,042
Whatever. You're not old enough to
appreciate the emotion of grunge.

244
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:48,633
You still got baby ears.

245
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:52,112
Excuse me!
Do you accept grain as payment?

246
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,979
Look, Mom. Someone die in this.

247
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,948
You know, I could have sworn
you were a customer.

248
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,685
Uh, well, you know, what we like to do...

249
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,058
is let the finicky diners do the...

250
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,757
Uh, Jessica, help me out here.

251
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,290
Oh, yes, well, uh...
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

252
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,098
- What are we doing?
- I have no idea.

253
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,731
Am I a waitress again, or am I still
pretending to be a customer, or am I...

254
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,434
Whoops.

255
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:25,446
I think we all agree that it's amazing
that I've lasted this long, right?

256
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,875
Okay, fine.

257
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,480
The truth is, Cattleman's
has got off to a shaky start.

258
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:37,616
I knew it! Your fax machine
wasn't tired, it was bored.

259
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,285
Hey, Connie, you missed it.

260
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,794
They finally admitted they're failing.

261
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:44,355
- Oh, I heard.
- That's my tiger shirt!

262
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,493
- You stole it from my bag!
- No, I found it.

263
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,367
One hundred percent off.

264
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,839
Thanks, Mom.

265
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,346
I don't know if this is a good time
to tell you this or not...

266
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:02,111
but I think that table of 10
is a no-show, so...

267
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,054
Last night was a disaster.

268
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,491
I don't want to leave this room.

269
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:17,960
Now <i>that</i> is a success perm.

270
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,792
I'm so tired.

271
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,861
- Nobody could have slept
worse than we did. - Mmm.

272
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:29,175
So, is anybody gonna talk
about Aunt Connie's boobs?

273
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,277
- Aaah!
- She heard me!

274
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,407
I was just looking for some sugar.

275
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,713
What are you boys doing in here?

276
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,050
They're there because we don't have
enough bedrooms. Are you happy?

277
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:42,113
Cattleman's Ranch is not doing well...

278
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,182
our house is small,
and you're Mom's favorite.

279
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,692
You win.

280
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:48,423
Jessica. I know how you feel.

281
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:52,934
But you'll get used to being
Mom's least favorite daughter. I did.

282
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,334
It was not so bad for you.

283
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,999
The only pictures she had in her wallet
were of you and Kurt Russell.

284
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:01,702
You saw inside her wallet?
I didn't think it opened.

285
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:06,578
I have to say, I never knew
being the favorite was so hard.

286
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:09,913
It takes a lot of patience.

287
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,920
I know.
When you watch <i>Wheel,</i> does she still...

288
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,583
yell at the TV screen
when someone buys a vowel?

289
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:19,684
"Vowels are a waste of money!"

290
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,521
- Josephine's missing!
- Who?

291
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:25,226
My Miata! Someone snatched Josie!

292
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,131
Why aren't you freaking out?

293
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:28,760
Aaah!

294
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,397
Yeah, Officer, you need to have
all units looking for my car.

295
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,306
It's a brand-new 1995 Miata.

296
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,311
Sir, you said the color of your car
is British racing green?

297
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,607
- Yes.
- <i>They discontinued...</i>

298
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,148
British racing green in the '95 model.

299
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:44,117
<i>The last year the BRG
was available was in the '93.</i>

300
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:47,383
It's used! I knew it!

301
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,619
Guess that alarm was fake too.
Whoop-whoop, my ass!

302
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,820
No, no, no. I-I-I got a special edition...

303
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:58,390
Sir, I've got two passions in life.
Law enforcement and Japanese sports coupes.

304
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:02,665
That's right. I, too, am a proud gay man
and Miata enthusiast.

305
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,399
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

306
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,067
Says a repo order
was issued for that car.

307
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,440
<i>Apparently the owner
is way behind in payments.</i>

308
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,275
Steve?

309
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:19,514
Okay, so I took out a few loans
to pay back some other loans.

310
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,318
We're in debt, and you didn't tell me?

311
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,189
- I thought we were cushy.
- We are cushy!

312
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,024
We're just a little low on cashola!

313
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,930
Are we poor?
Are they gonna take away my stuff?

314
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,489
I like my stuff!

315
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,196
Yo.

316
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,636
<i>Well, probably should have
hung up already, but I didn't.</i>

317
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,367
<i>So I heard all that.</i>

318
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:42,808
I'll mail you some literature about
the Miata Queens of Orlando.

319
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:45,039
We meet every other month, but whatever.

320
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,706
<i>You'll read about it.</i>

321
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:55,581
- What's going on?
- These two were fast asleep...

322
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,648
in the backseat of a Miata I repo'd.

323
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,320
It was more comfortable than the pantry.

324
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,886
Uh, of course!

325
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:06,457
My boys I was so worried about
and knew were gone!

326
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,197
Thank you for not repo'ing my children.

327
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,569
- No problem. Comes with the job.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,803
- As well as dibs on anything
we find in the cars. - Hmm.

329
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,717
Hello, Juice.

330
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:35,525
You know, for the record,
that dealer told me that Miata was new.

331
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:39,089
Well, people lie.
Sometimes even to themselves.

332
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:43,863
Hey, don't worry, okay?
I won't tell the family about any of this.

333
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,930
I know business has its ups and downs.

334
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,408
- You'll get back on your feet.
- I appreciate it, Louis.

335
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:51,344
You know, I got to say...

336
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,280
it'd be a lot easier
if I still had my best salesman.

337
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:59,016
Hey, if you ever need any advice,
just give me a call, okay?

338
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,681
Just not on my dedicated fax line,
'cause that's just for faxes.

339
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,787
There we go.

340
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,387
Sorry I got a little upset before.

341
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:11,694
Guess I just got caught up in
the emotion of the moment.

342
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:15,396
Really? 'Cause to me it looked like
you were straight-up crying.

343
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,768
But maybe my baby ears
didn't hear it right.

344
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,273
You guys want to listen to some 2Pac?

345
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,243
- Really? We can listen with you?
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,473
I'll go get some Sunny D and raisins.

347
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:27,742
I'll get our toothbrushes for after.

348
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:32,711
Well, I can't wait to get out
of this swampland.

349
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,551
Well, nothing's stopping you.

350
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:38,389
By the way, your hair looks terrible.

351
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,122
And your boobs are way too big.

352
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,190
Have a safe drive, Mom.

353
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,400
Well, she's coming around.

354
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:58,169
- Connie!
- Coming, Ah-ma.

355
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,278
<i>We all took
something away from that trip...</i>

356
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,448
<i>except Grandma, who set something loose.</i>

357
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:15,493
<i>And in the process,
we learned that just like 0.J...</i>

358
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,327
<i>people aren't always what they seem.</i>

359
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:21,498
I can't believe it. We won.

360
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,028
Yes, we did.
We finally proved Steve's Miata was used.

361
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:28,633
And we are always honest with each other.

362
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,439
We are the more successful couple.

363
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,106
You realize we're swimming in debt too.

364
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,672
Yes, but we're swimming together.

365
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,619
- Aw, man! Come on!
- Ew!

366
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,985
That one was gross.

367
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,489
I think that's a good idea.

368
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,990
Hmm.

369
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:54,500
