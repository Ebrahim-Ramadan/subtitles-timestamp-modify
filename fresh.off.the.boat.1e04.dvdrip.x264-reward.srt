1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,595
<i>It had been a few months since
we moved from DC to Orlando...</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,367
<i>and we were all looking forward
to my mom's family coming to visit.</i>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,340
- This is a nightmare.
- <i>Well, not all of us.</i>

4
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,505
You know your brother-in-law's only coming to
gloat about our restaurant not being successful.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,445
Louis, they're family.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,450
They're coming to gloat about
all of our misfortunes...

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,042
the restaurant, Eddie.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,146
Getting away from Steve
and his stupid store was supposed to be...

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,850
one of the perks of moving here.

10
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,892
Okay, we got the L-shaped sectional...

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,224
the entertainment center,
the deluxe love seat...

12
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,128
Is this man bothering you?
Say the word, and I'll call the police.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,563
That's funny.

14
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,197
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Oberg,
this is my boss-in-law, Steve.

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,900
I was just about to finalize...

16
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,704
Getting us all some Twizzlers.

17
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,745
There were no Twizzlers.

18
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,780
- We have Twizzlers?
- What? No.

19
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,576
I thought there were Twizzlers.

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,880
At least with your whole family coming...

21
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,113
Steve can't drive his stupid used Miata.

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,884
- Steve says his Miata is new.
- It's not new! It's used!

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm sorry. It's just I...

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,588
No, it's okay. You're right.

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,622
My sister can't wait to see us
struggling in this swampland.

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,101
- How do you know?
- She called me yesterday and she told me.

27
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,038
I can't wait to see your new home.

28
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,408
It's a little cozy...

29
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,470
but there's always room
for my dear sister.

30
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,847
The whole family's so proud of you.

31
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,752
She's just bitter because
I have always been Mom's favorite.

32
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,920
That's why she's coming.
She wants Mom to see us struggling.

33
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,792
But they will be in for a surprise...

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,424
when they see how well we are doing.

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,434
But we're not.

36
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,992
Yes, but they don't know that.

37
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,368
I've never loved you more.

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,405
- Gross!
- Ew!

39
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,378
I think it's great that you guys still
have passion in your marriage.

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,330
<i>My relatives were on their way...</i>

41
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,990
<i>but the way my parents were acting...</i>

42
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,228
<i>you would have thought
Mariah Carey was coming to visit.</i>

43
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,395
<i>I mean a hot, pre-Nick Cannon...</i>

44
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,531
<i>in the "Washington Wizards dress"
Mariah Carey.</i>

45
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:25,305
<i>They were putting up fake lemon trees
all over the house...</i>

46
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,403
<i>fancying up the bathroom.</i>

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,677
<i>Basically doing anything
they could to look like ballers.</i>

48
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,220
<i>The record should reflect now...</i>

49
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,085
<i>that the defendant
is present with counsel.</i>

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,818
<i>You may be seated, if you wish.</i>

51
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,689
<i>Even though my parents were tripping...</i>

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,024
<i>I was psyched because
my favorite cousin, Justin, was coming.</i>

53
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,155
<i>Justin was only six months
older than me...</i>

54
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,097
<i>but he was the one
who changed my life forever.</i>

55
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,035
Yo. Check this out.

56
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,403
<i>You are now about to witness...</i>

57
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,704
<i>the strength of street knowledge.</i>

58
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,843
<i>From that moment on, I was A. W. O...</i>

59
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,910
<i>Asian With Obsession.</i>

60
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,548
<i>I couldn't wait to show Justin
how deep my hip-hop knowledge had gotten.</i>

61
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,923
<i>Everything had to be perfect for
when I busted out the new 2Pac.</i>

62
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,086
What's a two-pack?

63
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,288
It's not for you.

64
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,853
Your baby ears aren't ready.

65
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,230
Remember the time a ladybug
crawled in my ear?

66
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,202
Evan, Emery.
Grandma Chu will be staying in your room.

67
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,464
- Grandma party!
- Yay!

68
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,130
You won't be sleeping there.

69
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,572
Aw.

70
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,472
I have made other arrangements.

71
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,102
Why can't we sleep on the couch?

72
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,977
Because then your aunt
and uncle will know...

73
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,040
we don't have enough bedrooms.

74
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,449
And they must never know that.

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,010
Okay, I just talked to Mitch...

76
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,215
and we have a great promotion
set for Saturday.

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,918
All the boomin' onions
you can eat for 99 cents.

78
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,723
Cattleman's will be packed
when we take your family there.

79
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,286
Won't you lose money?

80
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,559
Well, sometimes you have to
spend money you don't have...

81
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,466
to make it seem like you
have money that you don't spend.

82
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,004
- Mm!
- Okay, house is ready.

83
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,235
Now it's our turn. We need a new look.

84
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,836
We need a look that
instantly says... <i>success.</i>

85
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,571
<i>Let me explain.</i>

86
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,412
<i>In addition to fake lemon trees...</i>

87
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,510
<i>another thing Chinese people
did to show prosperity was get a perm.</i>

88
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,284
<i>I don't know why, but to my people,
curls were like dollar signs.</i>

89
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,553
These success perms were a great idea.

90
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:24,859
I feel like a curly-headed lion
surveying my kingdom.

91
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,493
They're coming! They're coming!

92
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,500
We're ready.

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,302
Oh!

94
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,636
Connie!

95
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:47,083
- Oh, your boobs are so big!
- I know. They're new.

96
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,314
I had to give up jogging.

97
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,823
Oh, I can tell.

98
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,189
Oh! They are big.

99
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,293
Nirvana?

100
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,630
Justin, yo, why you dressed like that?

101
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,297
It's grunge. It reflects
what I feel on the inside.

102
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,033
Your shirt looks like a picnic blanket.

103
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,802
Thank you.

104
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,743
Where's Steve?

105
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,850
He drove separately.

106
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,987
He drove separately for 13 hours...

107
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,321
- Mm.
- Just so he could bring that stupid car.

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:34,200
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

109
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,393
- He got a success perm too.
- I see that.

110
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,165
I can see that.

111
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,833
Did somebody order Chinese?

112
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,378
Ooh! Fancy place.

113
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,009
Have I got the "Huang" house?

114
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,612
- That's a
great joke, Steve. - Oh, hi!

115
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,451
Funny every time you tell it.

116
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,120
- Sweet ride, Uncle Steve.
- Hey, thanks, Emery.

117
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,721
If you work hard
and you're smart like me...

118
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,096
someday you can have a brand-new Miata.

119
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,930
Or used, because it's used.

120
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,539
Yo. You want to help me with this?

121
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,169
I have my own baggage.

122
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,213
Emotional.

123
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,444
So the furniture store is doing really well,
and I thought, why not?

124
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,486
You only live once, right?

125
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,453
And now you are equipped with airbags.

126
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,751
So, how was the trip down?

127
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,820
I know Mom can be
so critical of your driving.

128
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,390
- Oh, she was complaining the whole time...
- Mmm.

129
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,095
Ah! Ah-ma!

130
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,438
About you.

131
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,706
- What? - She's been feeling a
little abandoned, you know?

132
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,747
Because you abandoned her.

133
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,247
Connie!

134
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,452
Looks like you're
not her favorite anymore.

135
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,011
Guess who is.

136
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,252
Are you thinking?
Are you thinking about who is?

137
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,089
- Connie!
- Coming, Ah-ma.

138
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,232
And that's my Lazy Susan,
because, you know, sometimes we get lazy.

139
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,832
Oh, that's my, uh, pager.

140
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,840
We're opening a second store.
Business, right?

141
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,966
Tell me about it.

142
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,707
My restaurant is so successful,
I had to put in a dedicated fax line.

143
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,942
It seems kind of quiet now, Louis.

144
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,647
It's in recharge mode. Tired.

145
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,449
All right, Dad. It's all set up.

146
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,291
I brought along my Internet computer.

147
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,125
I need to check on my store's Web page.

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,528
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Yeah, go, go.

149
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,621
- Go to the bathroom. We got
plenty of time. - Okay.

150
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,559
<i>All right, Deputy Jex,
would you just take a step back, please?</i>

151
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,334
<i>This is people's 164-A?
Is that the right-hand glove?</i>

152
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:32,400
<i>Seems to be having a problem
putting the glove on his hand.</i>

153
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,015
The real Juice is loose.

154
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,660
Mom, would you like some tea?
You must be so tired.

155
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,529
I have green tea, oolong...

156
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,865
chrysanthemum, Sleepytime!

157
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,428
<i>Something was up
with my cousin, but whatever it was...</i>

158
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,133
<i>I knew what would snap him out of it.</i>

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,041
I was thinking we should start
with the old stuff and work forward.

160
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,241
Are you guys having a rap party?

161
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,804
I'm M.C. Hammer!

162
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,946
Get out!

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,487
Come on. Let's go.

164
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,115
Sorry about that. Kids.

165
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,454
I'm thinking of moving to Seattle.

166
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,919
Or we could just start with this.

167
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:28,057
Oh, uh, I'm not into 2Pac anymore.
He's just a little immature.

168
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,136
You want to listen
to some real grown-up music?

169
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,208
This woman's terrible.

170
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,357
Mom won't even talk to me.

171
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,258
Aw. That's too bad.

172
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,853
Thanks for letting me and Steve
stay in your bedroom.

173
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,831
It's cute. Like a little mouse shoe.

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,834
You are loving this, aren't you?

175
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,029
Not at all, but if you want...

176
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,699
I can put in a good word for you
with Mom during our evening chat.

177
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,800
We put on our slippers
and talk about the family.

178
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,506
- We call it "slipper talk."
- Okay, fine.

179
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,276
You may be Mom's new favorite...

180
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,116
but I'm going to win her back
by using what's most important to her.

181
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,054
- <i>Wheel of Fortune?</i>
- A good bargain.

182
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,389
You may be living your fancy lifestyle
with your ta-tas and your Miatas...

183
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,986
but what Mom cares about most
is stretching a dollar.

184
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,997
Oh, little sister.

185
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:37,365
Just because Steve and I are cushy
doesn't mean I can't sniff out a good deal.

186
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,701
Designer luggage... 75% off.

187
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,469
When I told Mom, she almost smiled.

188
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,807
Well, wait till I show her
these silk throw pillows.

189
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,643
Ninety percent off
from a condemned hospital.

190
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,377
Why don't we go shopping,
see who can find a better deal?

191
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,385
Well, let's take this to the Hole.

192
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,856
Tammy's Fashion Hole, where they have
an unprecedented selection of only left shoes.

193
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,985
What a coincidence.
That's my preferred discount shoe.

194
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,996
Connie!

195
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,691
Coming, Ah-ma!

196
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,108
Connie and my mom have "slipper talk."

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,343
- Steve has a fancy noise box.
- Yeah, it's called Connie.

198
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,008
We need to step up our game.

199
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,179
Don't worry, baby. We got this.

200
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,713
So, while this is happening,
I have a chance...

201
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,920
to say how excited I am to show you
Cattleman's Ranch tomorrow.

202
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,758
It's gonna be a full house.

203
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,764
Why wait to see this restaurant
I've heard so much about?

204
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,926
I made a reservation for tonight.

205
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:47,564
Oh, well, I don't think the restaurant
can accommodate on such short notice.

206
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,665
Oh, no, not a problem.
The manager was really nice.

207
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,210
He said there were plenty of tables.

208
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,803
Oh.

209
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,404
Oh.

210
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,972
Howdy. Cattleman's Ranch.

211
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,382
Mitch, how many tables
are booked for tonight?

212
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,150
Uh, let's see. Oh, just one.
Oh, but it's a big party of 10.

213
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,123
Okay, well, there's a change of plans.

214
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,057
Me and my family are coming in tonight.

215
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,992
<i>I need you to fill up the restaurant...</i>

216
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,256
any way you can.

217
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,888
I got that big party of 10 coming in.

218
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,830
No, <i>we're</i> the big party of 10!

219
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,461
- You and me?
- Me and my family are the big party of 10!

220
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,337
Let's go. Everybody in.
Dinner's on Uncle Louis tonight.

221
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,844
Do you like my outfit, Mom?
I got a great deal.

222
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,743
Half off on all sport separates.

223
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,679
Mom, you like my jacket?

224
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,184
It was 60% off,
and it glows in the dark...

225
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,586
so I save money on electricity too.

226
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,625
Oh, hey, boss man.

227
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,685
I see you've dropped by for a little
impromptu dinner with the kinfolk.

228
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,788
What's going on?
I told you to pack the place.

229
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,663
Yeah, but I did the best I could.
You gave me very little time.

230
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,702
Look, those are my ex-roommates,
Gwendolyn and Fritz.

231
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,294
They just came from the Renaissance Faire.

232
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,635
Hector and Nancy,
they're posing as customers.

233
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,767
And Charlene is the date
that I'm currently on.

234
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,470
This isn't enough people!

235
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,036
Don't worry about it.
We got that party of 10 coming in.

236
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,477
Hey.

237
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,381
Light crowd tonight, huh, Louis?

238
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,785
Well, this is just the awkward time
between old people dinner...

239
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,482
and regular dinner, so...

240
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,991
To the king!

241
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,192
Are you wearing a whole new outfit?

242
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,893
I bought so many affordable items today,
I couldn't pick just one.

243
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,994
Mom, this ski suit was 80% off,
and it came with one pole.

244
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,666
Tennis, Mother?
Eighty-five percent off.

245
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,108
Advantage, Connie.

246
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,671
So is, uh, anyone gonna take our order?

247
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,842
Uh...

248
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,218
Welcome to Cattleman's Ranch.
Can I start you off with some drinks?

249
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,030
Aren't you a customer?

250
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,264
So, tell me about you.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

251
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,636
Uh, not anymore. I mean, it's not exactly
something you talk about on a first date...

252
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,574
but for some reason,
I feel like I can really open up to you.

253
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,201
Oh, hold on one second.

254
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,768
Howdy. Cattleman's Ranch.

255
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,338
Yes, we do do to-go orders.

256
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,043
What's the name?

257
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:17,111
Okay, Orenthal... J... Sampson.

258
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,123
Okay.

259
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,759
This roll is stupid.

260
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,627
Dude, why are you such a bummer?

261
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,099
What can I say? I grew up.

262
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:33,537
No, you're played out,
listening to that sad, white-lady music.

263
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,042
Whatever. You're not old enough to
appreciate the emotion of grunge.

264
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,633
You still got baby ears.

265
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,112
Excuse me!
Do you accept grain as payment?

266
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,979
Look, Mom. Someone die in this.

267
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,948
You know, I could have sworn
you were a customer.

268
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,685
Uh, well, you know, what we like to do...

269
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,058
is let the finicky diners do the...

270
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,757
Uh, Jessica, help me out here.

271
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,290
Oh, yes, well, uh...
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

272
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,098
- What are we doing?
- I have no idea.

273
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,731
Am I a waitress again, or am I still
pretending to be a customer, or am I...

274
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,434
Whoops.

275
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,446
I think we all agree that it's amazing
that I've lasted this long, right?

276
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,875
Okay, fine.

277
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,480
The truth is, Cattleman's
has got off to a shaky start.

278
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,616
I knew it! Your fax machine
wasn't tired, it was bored.

279
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,285
Hey, Connie, you missed it.

280
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,794
They finally admitted they're failing.

281
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,355
- Oh, I heard.
- That's my tiger shirt!

282
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,493
- You stole it from my bag!
- No, I found it.

283
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,367
One hundred percent off.

284
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,839
Thanks, Mom.

285
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,346
I don't know if this is a good time
to tell you this or not...

286
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,111
but I think that table of 10
is a no-show, so...

287
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,054
Last night was a disaster.

288
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,491
I don't want to leave this room.

289
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,960
Now <i>that</i> is a success perm.

290
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,792
I'm so tired.

291
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,861
- Nobody could have slept
worse than we did. - Mmm.

292
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,175
So, is anybody gonna talk
about Aunt Connie's boobs?

293
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,277
- Aaah!
- She heard me!

294
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,407
I was just looking for some sugar.

295
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,713
What are you boys doing in here?

296
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,050
They're there because we don't have
enough bedrooms. Are you happy?

297
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,113
Cattleman's Ranch is not doing well...

298
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,182
our house is small,
and you're Mom's favorite.

299
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,692
You win.

300
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,423
Jessica. I know how you feel.

301
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,934
But you'll get used to being
Mom's least favorite daughter. I did.

302
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,334
It was not so bad for you.

303
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,999
The only pictures she had in her wallet
were of you and Kurt Russell.

304
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,702
You saw inside her wallet?
I didn't think it opened.

305
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:56,578
I have to say, I never knew
being the favorite was so hard.

306
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,913
It takes a lot of patience.

307
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,920
I know.
When you watch <i>Wheel,</i> does she still...

308
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,583
yell at the TV screen
when someone buys a vowel?

309
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,684
"Vowels are a waste of money!"

310
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,521
- Josephine's missing!
- Who?

311
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,226
My Miata! Someone snatched Josie!

312
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,131
Why aren't you freaking out?

313
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,760
Aaah!

314
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,397
Yeah, Officer, you need to have
all units looking for my car.

315
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,306
It's a brand-new 1995 Miata.

316
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,311
Sir, you said the color of your car
is British racing green?

317
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,607
- Yes.
- <i>They discontinued...</i>

318
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,148
British racing green in the '95 model.

319
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,117
<i>The last year the BRG
was available was in the '93.</i>

320
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,383
It's used! I knew it!

321
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,619
Guess that alarm was fake too.
Whoop-whoop, my ass!

322
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,820
No, no, no. I-I-I got a special edition...

323
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,390
Sir, I've got two passions in life.
Law enforcement and Japanese sports coupes.

324
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:52,665
That's right. I, too, am a proud gay man
and Miata enthusiast.

325
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,399
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

326
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,067
Says a repo order
was issued for that car.

327
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,440
<i>Apparently the owner
is way behind in payments.</i>

328
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,275
Steve?

329
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,514
Okay, so I took out a few loans
to pay back some other loans.

330
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,318
We're in debt, and you didn't tell me?

331
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,189
- I thought we were cushy.
- We are cushy!

332
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,024
We're just a little low on cashola!

333
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,930
Are we poor?
Are they gonna take away my stuff?

334
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,489
I like my stuff!

335
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,196
Yo.

336
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,636
<i>Well, probably should have
hung up already, but I didn't.</i>

337
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,367
<i>So I heard all that.</i>

338
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,808
I'll mail you some literature about
the Miata Queens of Orlando.

339
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,039
We meet every other month, but whatever.

340
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,706
<i>You'll read about it.</i>

341
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,581
- What's going on?
- These two were fast asleep...

342
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,648
in the backseat of a Miata I repo'd.

343
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,320
It was more comfortable than the pantry.

344
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,886
Uh, of course!

345
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,457
My boys I was so worried about
and knew were gone!

346
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,197
Thank you for not repo'ing my children.

347
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,569
- No problem. Comes with the job.
- Mm-hmm.

348
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,803
- As well as dibs on anything
we find in the cars. - Hmm.

349
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,717
Hello, Juice.

350
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,525
You know, for the record,
that dealer told me that Miata was new.

351
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:29,089
Well, people lie.
Sometimes even to themselves.

352
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,863
Hey, don't worry, okay?
I won't tell the family about any of this.

353
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,930
I know business has its ups and downs.

354
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,408
- You'll get back on your feet.
- I appreciate it, Louis.

355
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,344
You know, I got to say...

356
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,280
it'd be a lot easier
if I still had my best salesman.

357
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,016
Hey, if you ever need any advice,
just give me a call, okay?

358
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,681
Just not on my dedicated fax line,
'cause that's just for faxes.

359
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,787
There we go.

360
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,387
Sorry I got a little upset before.

361
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,694
Guess I just got caught up in
the emotion of the moment.

362
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,396
Really? 'Cause to me it looked like
you were straight-up crying.

363
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,768
But maybe my baby ears
didn't hear it right.

364
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,273
You guys want to listen to some 2Pac?

365
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,243
- Really? We can listen with you?
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,473
I'll go get some Sunny D and raisins.

367
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,742
I'll get our toothbrushes for after.

368
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,711
Well, I can't wait to get out
of this swampland.

369
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,551
Well, nothing's stopping you.

370
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:28,389
By the way, your hair looks terrible.

371
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,122
And your boobs are way too big.

372
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,190
Have a safe drive, Mom.

373
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,400
Well, she's coming around.

374
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,169
- Connie!
- Coming, Ah-ma.

375
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,278
<i>We all took
something away from that trip...</i>

376
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,448
<i>except Grandma, who set something loose.</i>

377
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,493
<i>And in the process,
we learned that just like 0.J...</i>

378
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,327
<i>people aren't always what they seem.</i>

379
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,498
I can't believe it. We won.

380
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,028
Yes, we did.
We finally proved Steve's Miata was used.

381
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,633
And we are always honest with each other.

382
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,439
We are the more successful couple.

383
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,106
You realize we're swimming in debt too.

384
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,672
Yes, but we're swimming together.

385
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,619
- Aw, man! Come on!
- Ew!

386
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,985
That one was gross.

387
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,489
I think that's a good idea.

388
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,990
Hmm.

389
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:44,500
